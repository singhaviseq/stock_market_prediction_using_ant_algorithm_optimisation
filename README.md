# stock_market_prediction_using_ant_algorithm_optimisation

The project involves an optimisation procedure towards a basic stock database. The best route path of ants (representing stocks) and cities (representing dates) is charted through the bio inspired ant colony optimisation algorithm and then the qualities are passed to the prediction model that is created within the ACO. Once applied to the stocks through the stock access module stocker, the best path as well as the price on the given day of the prediction is calculated and displayed along with the confidence upper limit and lower limit, the area within which is shaded. The time is also a key factor in determining the best route for the problem as it helps set a trend and therefore train through the available data. It will then be able to decide on its current path which route to take (predict) based on its past decisions in the dataset as accessed by the stocker module into the program.
